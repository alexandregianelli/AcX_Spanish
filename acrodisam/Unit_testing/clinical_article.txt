Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is commonly found in immunocompromised patients. This microorganism rarely infects immunocompetent individuals, and when it does, it causes mild symptoms. The radiological findings of this disease may involve an intrapulmonary mass that mimics lung tumor. The objective of this study was to review the clinicopathological information, radiological findings, and treatment of patients who presented with intrapulmonary mass due to cryptococcosis. This study collected data from 7 patients who were treated at Songklanagarind Hospital, Songkhla, Thailand, between 2009 and 2014. Their clinical data, radiological findings, pathological results, and treatment protocols were reviewed. The patients were 2 women and 5 men, ranging in age from 37 to 79 years old. One case was an immunocompromised host. Four cases experienced the chest symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chronic cough. The most common location of mass was the left lower lobe (71%). Four cases had a history of bird contact. Lung lobectomy was performed in 3 cases (42%), and all of the patients were treated with oral fluconazole. An intrapulmonary mass caused by this microorganism is mainly found in immunocompetent patients. Treatment with the antifungal drug fluconazole is very effective.

Introduction
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a rare lung infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. This microorganism usually causes severe pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient, especially in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and can lead to death.1–3 However, immunocompetent hosts are rarely infected by this organism and usually experience silent symptoms. The signs and symptoms of this disease in immunocompetent patients are quite nonspecific. As a result, many cases are misdiagnosed as other diseases such as lung cancer. The diagnosis of this infection employs chest X-rays and computed tomographic (CT) scans to detect the lung lesion in combination with tissue biopsy and tissue culture to identify the specific type of microorganism. The chest X-ray findings in immunocompromised patients usually indicate diffuse lung infiltration. But in a normal host, the findings can be a lung mass that sometimes mimics lung cancer. So, the correct diagnosis of a lung mass is necessary for an appropriate treatment.

This study reports 7 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis with radiological findings of lung mass. The objective of this study was to review the clinical data, radiological findings, lung histology results, and treatment of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients who presented with lung mass.

Materials and Methods
Study patients
This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution. The subjects of this study were 7 patients who were treated at Songklanagarind Hospital, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand, between 2009 and 2014.

Data collection
This study collected clinical data that consisted of age, sex, underlying disease, symptoms, and history of bird contact. Radiological data from chest X-rays and CT scans along with pathologic and treatment data were also collected. The patients with incomplete data were excluded from this study.

Results
Sex and age
The patients in this study were 5 men and 2 women. Their ages ranged from 39 to 79 years, and the mean age was 54.7 years.

Immune status and underlying disease
In all, 6 patients were immunocompetent hosts, and 1 of them had underlying diabetes mellitus. Only 1 patient was an immunocompromised host due to having underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. A history of bird contact was reported in 4 patients.

Symptoms and signs
Three cases did not have any chest-related symptoms, and their lung lesions were detected at an annual checkup via a chest X-ray. Two cases had mild chest symptoms—chronic cough and weight loss. The remaining 2 cases had severe chest symptoms—hemoptysis and dyspnea. In the cases that had chest symptoms, the time from symptom to diagnosis was 1 to 4 months. No cases had any neurological involvement.

Laboratory investigation
Blood serological tests for cryptococcal antigen were done in 3 cases, and the results showed positive in 1 case. A sputum culture was done in only 1 case, and the results showed positive for C neoformans. A tissue culture for fungal organisms was not done in any of the cases.

Radiological findings
The chest X-rays of all cases revealed lung masses that ranged from 1.2 to 12 cm in diameter. The most frequent location of the mass was the lower left lobe of the lung (71%). One case had a lesion in the upper left lobe, and one case in the lower right lobe.

Figure 1 illustrates an example. Figure 1A shows a 3-cm mass with a well-defined border in the upper left lobe. Figure 1B and C shows enhanced and nonenhanced CT images of the mediastinal window of the middle lung that shows 2 nodules. The larger nodule was an irregularly bordered, homogeneous, 2.4-cm mass attached to the left lateral chest wall without the presence of destruction. The smaller 0.7-cm nodule lied medially. Figure 1D shows the lung window of the middle-lung CT image that revealed 2 nodules with irregular and well-defined borders in the lingular segment of the upper left lobe.
